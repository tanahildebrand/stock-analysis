# Excel VBA Stock Analysis
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to refactor Excel VBA code to determine if performance was improved. We were provided stock performance data for 2017 and 2018 across 12 stocks, which included trading volumes and opening/closing price per day. The initial code resulted in a run time between 1.27-1.31 seconds.

## Results
The refactored code makes use of the array function, which allowed me to write the program using only one variable, representing each stock index (0-11). The array allows for shorter loops.

Below is the refactored code:

The refactored code reduced the run time to

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring Code
Refactoring code is a critial step in the development process. The advantages of refactoring can include improved processing times and detection of bugs. When code is simplified, organized and properly commented, it allows for easier understanding and reduces the risk that future changes are improperly done. Refactoring code does have disadvantages. It takes time to refactor, which can lead to project delays and additional cost.
